<br />

Inspecting the data and seeing what i can add as an insight or argument that can be made for when i work on this in SQL. So far i've come up with 8-10 arguments and due to this being syntehtic it would be hard to center this on one argument hence i'll section this data to market segmentation inisghts and sale performance report.
 
<br />
BigQuery:  <br/>

<br />

This is my first time using Bigquery and learning how to operate it was all new to me which was why i came up with a lot of syntax issues and needed assistance from my friend how had help me understand it ( i'll explain it more)

<br />

Here are all the arguments that i came up with and added. [explain why i used rank over row number and  also what i did with the int64]

<br />
Importing my data to excel:  <br/>

<br />

I decided to put my work on Bigquery onto excel. After finishing this project i learned that it would be convenient for me to add all my tables together so it will be easier for me to use slicers and match them together better

<br />
Then transferring my data to PowerBI to make a dashboard :  <br/>
